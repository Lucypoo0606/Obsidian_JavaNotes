- Syntax in Comparison to C follows a different structure

### Syntax

```C
//C syntax
int main(){
printf("hello world");
return 0;
}
```

```java
public class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		system.out.printIn("Hello world");
	}
}

```

#### structure
- C: no class is ever required, instead uses standalone functions
- Java: Based on classes. Everything is a class, with all code being wrapped inside of a class definition

#### Libraries
- C: Uses the <include> before the int main to specify the possible different attached operators that can be used within the rest of the program.
-  The library is implicit and does not need to be specified within the program
#### Entry Point
